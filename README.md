# Microfrontend

Scalable app with a microfrontend architecture and module federation.


Microfrontends are used to divide a large app into a series of smaller apps. This provides a set of unique benefits to any frontend:

1 - Author smaller, easier to understand codebases

2 - Use a different set of libraries for each sub-app - bring the best tool for the job!

3 - Deploy each portion separately - limit the chance of interrupting your users

4 - Allow each of your engineering teams to work independently
